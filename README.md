## This Project is in beta, use at your own risk.
HOT is an experimental protocol building upon the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance, employs a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance.

Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, HOT is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no pre-mine, no founder shares, no VC interests â€” simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
## Token DHOT (Devil HOT)
We have enabled 1:1 mapping between HOT and DHOT.

There is no time limit for mapping, the mapping page will always be open

Here is our Mapping URL:https://hotpepper.finance/swap.html

**Token Symbol**: DHOT(Devil Pepper)

**Token Contract**: TFZuttvMGETrzUzP8uXiKKnC8wpJgE7QBW

**Total Supply**: 50,000 DHOT

**DHOT monitor**: https://hotpepper.finance/watch.html

**Number of tokens in circulation**: 15,000 DHOT

We will strictly control the output of the LP mining pool to maintain the circulation of DHOT below 15,000, so as to maintain a high burning rate.
