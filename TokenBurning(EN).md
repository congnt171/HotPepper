# Token mapping

We will first perform token mapping after the end of the first phase of the mining pool. 

The team will give the following three mapping ratios, which are determined by community voting. 

After mapping, the total amount will be fixed and will not be inflation;

The following is a detailed example:

+ Mapping ratio: 1:1  

Total amount before mapping: 50,000

Total amount after mapping: 50,000

+ Mapping ratio: 1:100 

Total amount before mapping: 50,000

Total amount after mapping: 5,000,000

+ Mapping ratio: 1:1000 

Total before mapping: 50,000 

Total after mapping: 50,000,000

## Transaction burn

Transaction burning trigger conditions:

All transfers, including ordinary transfers, justswap swap, and justswap add liquidity operations, will burn when the above three operations are triggered.

The transaction burning will include the following three parts: (the target address of each part will be publicized, and the following ratio is the initial ratio, which will be implemented after the community votes)

+ 1. Burning rate                                                                          3%
    The setting of the burning rate is related to the total amount of tokens t after mapping. Take 1:1 mapping as an example
    
    25,000 ≤ t ≤ 50,000        combustion rate R% = 3%
    
    10,000 ≤ t <25,000         combustion rate R% = 1%
    
    t <10,000                  Whether to continue burning is determined by community voting

Due to the liquid mining LP of HOT itself.

HOT will undergo extreme deflation within 1 month after the start of combustion, with a total deflation target of 10,000.

+ 2. Team community technology development part (hereinafter referred to as team retention) 0.9%

+ 3. Dividend pool                                                                          2.1%

Part of which will resevrve by Development Team.

Take ordinary transfer as an example:

The following is a detailed example:

+ 1. <Address A> tries to transfer 1000 HOT to <Address B>;
  
+ 2. Assuming that the current burn rate is 3%, the team retention ratio is 0.9%, and the dividend pool ratio is 2.1%, 

  30 of them will be completely destroyed. 9 HOTs will be transferred to the team address, and the remaining 21 HOTs will be transferred to the dividend pool;

+ 3. Finally, <Address B> received 940 HOTs.
  
## Holding currency dividend + LP liquidity mining.

+ LP liquidity mining

At the end of the first phase of the mining pool, after the original token HOT is mapped, the liquidity mining HOTT/TRX of the mapped token HOTT will be started. 

The LP tokens generated after the liquidity is mortgaged can continue to mine HOTT.

In addition to our own HOTT/TRX liquidity mining, we will open a community vote to let the community decide whether to open other token liquidity mining.

+ Hold currency dividends

Conditions for opening currency dividends:

   1. It has been more than 2 days since the token was launched on the AMM exchange;
   
After the dividend mechanism is turned on, dividends will be distributed every 24 hours.

The snapshot time is 0:00 every day. 

All token holders except liquidity providers will be snapshots.

The dividend pool HOTT * 45%> the number of addresses that meet the dividend conditions, the dividend will be paid.

When dividends are distributed, all addresses that meet the dividend conditions will be equally divided into the dividend pool * 45% of HOTT.

The 2.1% dividend pool generated during the transaction burning will include the following two parts:

       Holding currency dividends: 45% of the dividend pool HOTT;
       
       Prize pool (for FOMO):      45% of HOTT bonus pool;
       
       We will reserve 10% of the subsequent injection of liquidity, and the obtained processing fees will be used to buy back HOT.(The plan is reserved)
       
There are two conditions for participating in currency dividends:

  1. Within 24 hours before the snapshot, there is no HOTT transfer from this address;
  
  2. In the 24 hours before the snapshot, the number of HOTTs in this address has been maintained ≥ 10 (this ratio is determined by community voting).
  
  The design of HOT to evenly share the dividends when the standard is reached makes it no longer a game of giant whales to hold currency dividends, and experimenters with small funds can also get a lot of money.
  
## FOMO

Our burning mechanism will include the tail-order game function.

We have retained the FOMO implementation interface. 

The specific parameters in FOMO will open community voting again before FOMO goes online.

## Before the project goes live, we will conduct a small-scale test and convene some experience officers to help us adjust the above parameters
